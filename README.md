## Problem Statement üöß

-  HealthCare

-  COVID Tracking and Escalation

## Background üìñ

 As of 30th June 2020, there are 560,000+ cases of the novel Corona Virus reported in India, out of which  about 16,500 people have lost there lives, and the worse part is this number is still growing. 

 There are two ways to combat COVID-19, Flattening the curve, or raising the line. While flattening the curve is achieved by people being socially distant, raising the line is achieved by raising the capacity of healthcare facilities available. Our Web Application is based on the second aspect, i.e raising the line.

  The Novel Coronavirus has four stages of transmission:

- Stage 1: First Appearance
- Stage 2: Local Transmission
- Stage 3: Community Transmission
- Stage 4: National Epidemic <br>

 India as of today has entered *stage 3* and there still isn't any sign of vaccines or drugs. So the only way out currently is to stop further spread of this virus as much as we can.

## About Our Product üîß

### What

 We at team covidcoders, propose a Web-application which is preventive, personalized and most importantly affordable. Our web-app called, **'Covid Care'**, serves the purpose of tracking and escalation of people who might be COVID suspects based on the inputs provided by individuals. This information is provided by the user voluntarily and stays safe within our database. We do not store any essential data, as Security of the system is our priority. The WebApp provides minimalist interface aimed at users from all age groups. 

 With our product, we implement two chatbots, one of them is designated for a pre screening of the patient which is done before assigning a doctor, and the other a 'Mental Health' Chatbot, which is aimed to check the User's mood and provide them engaging and fun activities. 

 The second phase of the WebApp is aimed at reaching out to available doctors, booking tests and provides news information about the current state of COVID around the world. It also implements a feature of 'reporting people' using which people can report probable COVID suspects.

 There's a third separate section in which we embed reliable information from sources such as YouTube, News Sources, and Quizzes as the basic informational guide.

 Covid Care is expanded to a mobile application which is a WebView of our WebApplication and is built using React Native.

 We also implement a 'tracking' feature for the User to track their health visually by synthesizing data in the form of vitals taken during the User's conversation with our Chatbot.

 We also plan to have an in house Mental Assessment Quiz that will help the User stay happy and sane even when they are restricted to four walls.

### Why

 With Covid Care, we aim at providing a simple interface so users from all age groups can use it, and can be aware about the situation. Due to restrictions in movement, and the lockdown that we are under, most people are unable to consult physicians/doctors or book tests. Our Product, Covid Care comes to aid as it connects individuals with doctors provides features as online pathology labs, which are functional in the zone so the user can avail these neccesities without having to step out of their houses. We provide simple and minimal UI/UX in a small storage space as we provide a simple WebView of our Web App in a React Native Application.

### How

 We have come up with an idea, 'STAE-C', which expands to 'Systematic Tracking and Escalation Checking' for COVID-19. The Process Flow is in the following order:

- First the User takes a screening test about symptoms while having a conversation with our Chatbot.
- If the Chatbot predicts that the User might be carrying significant symptoms, it refers a Doctor to the User.
- Data fed to the chatbot (Health Vitals) is used for visual representation for better analysis. 
- The User can interact with the Doctor using a  after booking an appointment and report about more symptoms and vital information.
- If the Doctor confirms that the User might be a probable patient of COVID-19, the Doctor suggests the required tests for confirmation.
- Covid Care now helps connect the User to the Pathology Lab, wherein the User's sample can be taken for further evaluation.
- If the test results come positive, details of the user are shared with designated authorities for a better escalation.

 The User's personal details as Address or Mobile Number are kept private. Only Name, Age, gender and other essential details are shared with the Doctor. Aforementioned details and the Email Address of the user are shared with the Pathology Lab to enable the User to view and connect with the Lab and vice versa. Only if the result is positive, all required details are shared with authorities.

 This process reduces unwanted hastle by reducing the time and effort that needs to be put up by a user to test himself or herself for COVID. Users will be at ease to use the app irrespective of their age because of its simplicity and integration, all at one place, while boosting the efficiency in monitoring the situation and people.
